[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=nodejs,express,mongo)](https://skillicons.dev)
## NodeJS basisc + ExpressJS

In this course, I successfully learned how to run a Node.js server locally and how to use and set "listeners" on the server for CRUD operations. I also learned about the Express.js framework, which helps write more efficient and concise code. Additionally, I discovered how middleware works- functions that run between a request and a response. I learned about the MVC organization structure to provide more readable code. In this project, I also used a database to communicate the server with data in an external environment.

## Utility
- Adding blogs to the server with a simple form

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- EJS
- Morgan

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/xcinek1337/nodejs-crash-course.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. You can add your MongoDB URL, but for this example, I provide my test collection(YOU CAN SKIP THIS STEP):
   ```bash
    const dbURII = your_mongodb_uri
   ```
4. Start the server (make sure you have nodejs): 
    ```bash
    node app
    ```
    or (automatically restart the server after code changes)
    ```
    nodemon app
    ```
